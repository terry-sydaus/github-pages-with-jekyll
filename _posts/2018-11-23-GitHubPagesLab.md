I am so loving this GitHub Lab to learn how to create this blog and everything else that it is teaching me, including:
1. GitHub Pages
2. How to use GitHub, specifically:
   1. How to write markdown - pretty cool, never knew about this before.
   2. How to create:
      1. Issues
      2. Branches
      3. Edit code in a branch (not the master so as to not damage production code).
      4. Commit changes to new branch.
      4. Pull requests to allow commited changes to be incorporated back into the master branch.
      5. Deletion of branch after pull request has been accepted.
      6. And closing issues automatically using "close #2" as a description in the pull request, for example, to close issue number 2.


**This is just all so cool and amazing. I am addicted to this stuff!!**
